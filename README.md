# Ai-Chatbot-Cafe-Assistant
This project implements an intelligent barista chatbot for Barca Café, designed to take customer orders, answer menu-related questions, and generate order summaries. The system integrates a JSON-based menu knowledge base and uses Google’s Gemini AI model via LangChain to provide conversational, context-aware interactions in both Arabic and English.
